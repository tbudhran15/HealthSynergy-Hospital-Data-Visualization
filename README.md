# HealthSynergy Data Visualization Project

## Objectives

Our goal with HealthSynergy was to revolutionize healthcare data analytics by creating a dynamic platform that offers real-time, interactive, and comprehensive insights into hospital operations. The primary objectives were to empower hospital administrators and medical staff with valuable information, facilitate seamless decision-making, and adapt the platform to evolving healthcare needs.

## Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, spans two years and includes patient records from the Hero DMC Heart Institute in Ludhiana, India. With 28 features covering patient profiles, medical histories, laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and outcomes, the dataset provides a robust foundation for insightful visualizations.

## Investigation Focus

### Hospital Statistics Dashboard

- **Admission Trends:** Explore patterns and seasonality in hospital admissions.
- **Patient Outcomes:** Analyze distribution of outcomes, including discharges and mortalities.
- **Comorbidity Analysis:** Investigate the prevalence of comorbidities among admitted patients.
- **Admission Statistics:** Provide detailed overview of admission statistics.

### Main Dashboard

- **Patient Demographics:** Visualize age distribution and gender ratios of admitted patients.
- **Admission Trends:** Present charts representing admission trends over time.
- **Outcome Analysis:** Visualize distribution of patient outcomes.

### Patient Dashboard

- **Patient Information Display:** Comprehensive overview of individual patient records.
- **Additional Patient Statistics:** Display additional statistics, including number of visits and engagement duration.
- **Comorbidities Statistics:** Showcase prevalence of various conditions for selected patient.
- **Discharge Date Exploration:** Investigate and display discharge dates for first and last visits.

### Custom Dashboard

- **Dataset Information:** Overview of available data types and categories.
- **Variable Analysis:** Univariate and bivariate analysis options for comprehensive exploration.
- **Customizability:** Dynamic selection of variables and visualization types.

### Bio Stats Research Dashboard

- **Age and Duration of Stay:** Explore relationship between age and duration of stay.
- **Age, Platelet Count, and DM:** Visualize interplay between age, platelet count, and diabetes.
- **HTN, CKD, and Duration of Stay:** Analyze interaction effect of hypertension and chronic kidney disease on duration of stay.
- **Hemoglobin, ICU Stay, and Heart Failure:** Investigate relationship between hemoglobin levels, intensive unit stay duration, and heart failure.
